Summary
- Merged : adds an embedded POCSAG encoder and UI trigger to send POCSAG pager messages from the device.
- Makefile: default  set to  to reduce FLASH usage so POCSAG fits in the image.
- Messenger: safe string handling and  wrapper added; UI entry is gated by .

Notes / Known constraints
- This build fits in the device FLASH with AIRCOPY disabled: FLASH reported ≈ 50,156 bytes (≈81.6% of 60KB region).
- If you re-enable large receiver features (e.g. , , ), the image may exceed available FLASH.

Flashing instructions (generic)
1. Put your device in bootloader mode (see device docs).
2. Use the recommended flasher from  or your usual programmer.
3. Example: 
4. If using the packed image, use the provided  tooling as required.

If you want additional artifacts (map, symbol tables, .out), tell me and I will upload them as release assets as well.
